                            “DNA is the polymer that scientists dream about” [1]. Besides containing all human genetic information, its physical properties make it perfect to build nanoscale structures due to the following:  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                                <ol>

                                </ol>       
                    <br>
                            These three features allowed the discovery of DNA nanotechnology; construction of two and three dimensional shapes using DNA as a building material. Throughout the years, distinct branches of this field have been developed including DNA Origami [2].
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            Building beautiful, complex and functional structures by folding a piece of paper is much more transcendental than the macroscale art we all know as origami. In 2006, Paul Rothemund discovered a way in which DNA, the molecule of life, could be adapted into the Japanese technique of origami.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            The culmination of this discovery made scientists acknowledge that DNA Origami is one of the most powerful forms of DNA nanotechnology. The technique consists of folding a long strand of ssDNA (scaffold) using small oligonucleotides (staples) complementary to specific sections of the scaffold; achieving the construction of two and three dimensional structures [3]. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            DNA is the perfect organic polymer considered by many investigators, mainly because we can alter it precisely to the point that we can form pre designed structures but with the ability to maintain the properties of a DNA chain, like stability, roughness, stiffness, somewhat elastic and resistant. Structures with DNA base became popular this last years because all of the structural and mechanical properties, but when we mix a great geometrical structure with a great building material, we get one of the greatest biostructures known to humankind.

                        <a name="dna-rna"><div class="body-subtitle">DNA-RNA Hybrids </div></a>
                            In human biology, RNA plays a vital role as a molecule of life. Part of this is due to its structure and chemical properties. Yet, it is also because its complexity that molecular RNA de novo design and engineering is limited [4]. As a solution, folding RNA has been proposed as an adaptation of the DNA origami technique. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            DNA-RNA hybridization attempts to give DNA nanotechnology a new field of application and functionality. The folding process of the RNA follows the same principles of DNA origami [5]; the complementarity between two strands, in this case, RNA and DNA. And similarly, RNA-DNA origami relies on protocols already used for nucleic-acid self-assembly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            Distinct works have been developed in this area. There have been studies of the possible methodologies to hybridize these two molecules into complex non-functional nanostructures [4]. It has also been applied to construct RNA-DNA as siRNA delivery [6].

                        <a name="mrna-therapy"><div class="body-subtitle">mRNA Therapy </div></a>
                            <div class= "body-subsubtitle" style="text-indent: 3em">what is mRNA?</div>
                                To answer this question, it is important to define what a protein is. A protein is a “workhorse” of the cell [7], they carry out vital functions of life; enzymes, hormones, antibodies, they are all proteins.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                                Proteins are expressed by genes; which are specific sections of DNA. The manufacture from DNA to proteins happens in two main steps: transcription and translation. In the first step, a DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). In the second step, mRNA is translated into the amino acids that build up a protein [8]. Fundamentally, messenger RNA is a set of instructions to express any protein inside the human body. 
                            <div class= "body-subsubtitle" style="text-indent: 3em">mrna as a therapy</div>
                                The fundamental principle behind mRNA based therapies is the transfer of a defined genetic message into the cells of a patient for the ultimate purpose of instructing the human body to produce its own proteins to fight, prevent, or alter a wide range of diseases [10].

                        Our project was born out of the idea that mRNA needs to be stabilized inside the human body in order to be delivered as a drug 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        By stabilizing mRNA we believe that mRNA half-life and translation levels can be increased, leading to the overall production of significant levels of the encoded protein over a longer timeframe [14]. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Naked mRNA is quickly degraded by extracellular RNases and is not internalized efficiently [13]. Therefore, a great variety of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> transfection reagents have been developed that facilitate cellular uptake of mRNA. These reagents can be divided into three main categories: physical methods (including electroporation and sonication); viral-based approaches, and nonviral vectors ( such as lipid-based delivery systems) [15].
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        mRNA based therapies are not the only RNA-related treatments that are being developed worldwide; small interfering RNA therapies are used in order to block protein expression [14]. The small size of siRNA allow it to be more easily protected against degradation than mRNA. Because its size, molecular weight, stability, and tendency to form secondary structures, mRNA delivery presents a more challenging endeavor. 
                        Our solution is to build a structure that stabilizes the mRNA molecule inside the human body.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <a name="solution"><div class="body-subtitle">The solution</div></a>
                        Our solution builds a stabilizing structure that can deliver the mRNA molecule inside the human body, and what better way to do it than through a complementarity system?    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        The proposal is to build a hybridized mRNA-DNA tetrahedron based on the DNA Origami technique, that after a set of anti-staples are injected, will release the mRNA strand by strand-displacement mechanism.
                    
                    <div class="body-subsubtitle" style="text-indent: 3em">Tetrahedron</div>

                    <div class= "body-subsubsubtitle">Tetrahedron as a three-dimensional structure</div>    
                    The triangle is one of the most resilient and stable structures. We use the shape of a triangle as a basis of our structure because it requires a lot of energy to collapse on itself. The decision of using a tetrahedron over any other 3D structure was simple: because its low-energy conformation, the tetrahedron is one of the most stable three-dimensional structures that can be found or made artificially. [18, p. 19]
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Its stability is based on the principle of asymmetrical bistable structure, which is defined as a structure that has two points where the internal energy U is more stable, with a slight differential between both of them. The energy in between both points is an unstable internal energy zone, which means that the structure does not want to be at that exact position or angle, but it can accept that position. This zone creates a bridge between both stabilities, but it offers a condition of flexibility to arrange the figure differently, even to overload it and maintain some point of the natural stability. [19]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <div class="body-subsubsubtitle">Tetrahedron as a wireframe structue</div>
                    As previously mentioned, the geometrical figure of a tetrahedron is stable, even if it suffers some alterations. But, what happens if the figure only consist of a DNA chain wireframe? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    DNA-based tetrahedron is simple yet efficient. Its form of assembly is easier than other structures considering materials, time and yield percentage. (Reference to 3D model). Using all the benefits of the stability of the tetrahedron, there are some special traits that we can exploit: flexibility, less superficial area and more critical points for system conjugation

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Starting with the flexibility and considering that the structure is hollow, it can support an external payload inside of it without compromising stability and the general charge of the molecule. This is beneficial to drug delivery systems, as the tetrahedron is a biomolecule that increments the biodisponibility and efficiency of inorganic drugs by encapsulating them, protecting the incoherent or rejectable traits and, simultaneously, letting the biomolecule to interact with the environment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the structure is mainly just a wire, the superficial area in general is low, making it resistant to external attacks of degrading agents and incrementing the life spawn in <i>in vivo </i>environments.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The tetrahedral shape of DNA Origami has the ability to resist against specific and non-specific nuclease attack by steric hindrance [20]. It has been proved that, despite being a negatively charged structure, DNA tetrahedron can be inserted into the cell by endocytosis transfection without any ligand or additional agent [21].  The cytotoxicity levels of this complementary carrier structure are minimal, due to the biological nature of the material. And additionally, having a compact and hybridized delivery system allows us to have more spatial control over the mRNA molecule [6].

                    RNA is unstable, it interacts with everything and degrades in record times, making it almost impossible to survive in an external environment rather than its normal one. But there are some methods to make it more durable, some put it inside a carrier, some others try to cluster it, others to protect the ‘soft spots’, but we are proposing a new method, making it the scaffold of a RNA based DNA origami structure, basically, protecting it by making it part of something bigger. DNA-RNA hybrid is not something new, actually in nature sometimes this wonderful event happens now or then. Scientists around the world were amazed and tried with so much effort to replicate it, with now many trustworthy lab procedures circulating the web that make it easy to reconstruct and modify. But we went a step further, we took the opportunity to build the hybrid and mix it with DNA origami, creating a new branch of complex biomolecule that not only can be used as a common drug carrier, but now even the structure itself can be used as the main drug, making the hybrid payload and carrier at the same time. This new approach to the problem solves different difficulties at the same time: RNA degrading time, carrier and payload, protection, biodisponibility, accessibility to the cells and good degrading rate in the target zone.

                            Strand displacement is a mechanism applied in the field of DNA Origami that allows DNA structures to be more dynamic and versatile. Also known as “toehold-mediated strand displacement”, the mechanism consists of replacing one strand in a double helix with another one, the resulting double helix will be more stable and favorable in terms of free energy than the initial one.

                            The DNA strand displacement technology is a simple, but a robust mechanism that allows us to create molecular logic circuits, catalytic amplifiers, autonomous molecular walkers and reprogrammable DNA nanostructures, and more. This mechanism can be explained as “the process through which two strands with partial or full complementarity hybridize to each other, displacing one or more pre-hybridized strands in the process” [16]. Basically, this results in the formation of a “new” double helix and the liberation of a single strand.

                            In any case, there are three strands involved, the “invading” strand is the strand that competes to bind to the “substrate” strand with the “incumbent” strand which is previously hybridized and at the end is the one that is released. This process is known by not requiring any external driver. 
                    <br>        
                    <br>
                            A fundamental factor of the strand displacement mechanism the toehold, a small, single-stranded domain in one of the pre-hybridized strands that once the invading strand is available, the mechanism begins. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            The size and strength (large and sequence composition) of the toeholds play an important role in the kinetics of the event, giving a controlled rate reaction of the strand displacement by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>. The invading strand shall be complementary with the substratate’s toehold, and thus, it will continue to bind to the substrate completely. This results in the rate of the reaction depending on the time it takes the invading-toehold strand duplex to form. It is important to remark that the invading-substrate duplex should be more energetically favorable than the incumbent-substrate duplex, so that the reaction is irreversible.

                    <br>
                            We can know the rate of the strand displacement reaction by the type of the toehold we have, depending if it is large or short. When the toehold is large, the rate of the reaction is given by the rate of hybridization between the invading strand and the toehold region. For short toeholds, we can calculate the rate with:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <center><i>e<sup>(G<sub>t</sub>/K<sub>b</sub>T)/b</sup></i></center>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Where <i>b</i> is the length of the incumbent strand and <i>G<sub>t</sub></i> is the free energy of the fully formed toehold [17].

                            Due to the objectives we’ve set, the strand displacement mechanism is an important part of the global therapy we want to enhance. The tetrahedron nanostructure we designed has a previously-sequenced mRNA as scaffold, complemented by ssDNA staples extended with their own toehold each. The strand displacement is the mechanism we need to be able to make the mRNA delivery in an <i>in vivo</i> system, which is our ultimate goal. This is due to the toeholds in the ssDNA staples in the axes of the tetrahedron, permitting us to carry on the reaction.

                            In our structure, the mRNA will as a scaffold and the DNA as the staples. The staples are characterized by having a toehold that will hybridize to the anti-staples. And so, the RNA scaffold will be released when the anti-staples are injected.
